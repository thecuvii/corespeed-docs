# What are Zypher Agents

Zypher Agents are autonomous AI systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools and services.

## Core Concept

Think of a Zypher Agent as an AI assistant that can:
- **Understand** complex requests in natural language
- **Plan** multi-step approaches to solve problems  
- **Execute** actions using external tools and APIs
- **Learn** from results and adapt its approach
- **Communicate** progress and results back to you

Unlike traditional chatbots that just generate text, Zypher Agents can actually *do* things in the real world.

## Agents vs Traditional Software

Traditional software follows predetermined workflows - you write code that defines exactly what happens in each scenario. Zypher Agents are different:

| Traditional Software | Zypher Agents |
|---------------------|---------------|
| **Fixed workflows** - Hard-coded logic for each task | **Dynamic reasoning** - LLM plans the approach based on context |
| **Rigid execution** - Same steps every time | **Adaptive planning** - Adjusts strategy based on results |
| **Manual integration** - Developer writes code for each tool | **Automatic tool usage** - Agent discovers and uses tools as needed |
| **Explicit error handling** - Pre-written code for each failure case | **Intelligent recovery** - Reasons about problems and finds solutions |

With Zypher Agents, you describe *what* you want accomplished, and the LLM brain figures out *how* to do it using available tools.

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { ZypherAgent, AnthropicModelProvider } from '@zypher/agent';

const agent = new ZypherAgent(
  new AnthropicModelProvider({ apiKey: "your-key" })
);

await agent.init();

// Agent can understand complex requests and execute them
const result = await agent.runTask("Find the latest news about AI and summarize the top 3 articles");
```

## What Makes Zypher Agents Powerful

### 🧠 **LLM-Powered Reasoning**
Built on state-of-the-art language models like Claude and GPT-4, giving agents sophisticated reasoning capabilities.

### 🛠️ **Tool Integration**
Connect to any external service through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/core-concepts/tools-and-mcp) - from web scraping to database queries.

### 🔄 **Loop Interceptors** 
Control execution flow with [interceptors](/docs/core-concepts/loop-interceptors) for error handling, token management, and custom logic.

### 📝 **Git Checkpoints**
Track changes with [automatic checkpointing](/docs/core-concepts/checkpoints) - revert to previous states when needed.

### ⚡ **Simple API**
Just a few lines of code to create powerful agents. No complex configuration required.
