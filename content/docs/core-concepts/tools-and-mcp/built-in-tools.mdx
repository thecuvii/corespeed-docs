- **File and directory copying** - Handle both individual files and entire directories
- **Preserve metadata** - Maintain file permissions and timestamps
- **Overwrite protection** - Safe handling of existing destination files

### delete_file

Remove files or directories from the file system.

```typescript
// Agent can clean up unnecessary files
await agent.runTask("Remove temporary files and build artifacts");
await agent.runTask("Delete the old migration files");
```

**Key features:**
- **Safe deletion** - Careful handling to prevent accidental data loss
- **Directory removal** - Can delete entire directory trees
- **Confirmation patterns** - Follows safe deletion practices

## Terminal Tools

### run_terminal_cmd

Execute shell commands and capture their output.

```typescript
// Agent can run system commands
await agent.runTask("Install the project dependencies");
await agent.runTask("Run the test suite and show results");
await agent.runTask("Check the git status and recent commits");
```

**Key features:**
- **Command execution** - Run any shell command available on the system
- **Output capture** - Capture both stdout and stderr
- **Environment support** - Works with environment variables and PATH
- **Cross-platform** - Handles differences between operating systems
- **Working directory** - Executes commands in the correct project context

**Common use cases:**
- **Package management** - `npm install`, `yarn add`, `deno add`
- **Build processes** - `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build`
- **Testing** - `npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`
- **Git operations** - `git status`, `git commit`, `git push`
- **System information** - `ps aux`, `netstat`, `df -h`

## Search Tools

### grep_search

Search through file contents using regular expressions and patterns.

```typescript
// Agent can find specific content in files
await agent.runTask("Find all TODO comments in the codebase");
await agent.runTask("Search for functions that use the deprecated API");
await agent.runTask("Locate all error handling patterns");
```

**Key features:**
- **Regular expression support** - Use powerful regex patterns for complex searches
- **Multi-file search** - Search across multiple files simultaneously
- **Context lines** - Include surrounding lines for better understanding
- **Case sensitivity control** - Configure case-sensitive or case-insensitive searches
- **File type filtering** - Limit searches to specific file types

**Search patterns:**
- **Text literals** - Simple string matching
- **Regex patterns** - Complex pattern matching with `\d+`, `\w+`, etc.
- **Word boundaries** - Use `\b` for exact word matches
- **Line anchors** - Use `^` and `$` for line start/end matching

## Image Tools

Image processing tools are available when configured for your specific use case.

```typescript
// When image tools are enabled, agent can:
await agent.runTask("Analyze this screenshot and extract the text");
await agent.runTask("Resize the product images for the web");
await agent.runTask("Convert the diagrams from PNG to SVG format");
```

**Capabilities:**
- **Image analysis** - Extract information from images
- **Format conversion** - Convert between different image formats
- **Resizing and optimization** - Adjust image dimensions and quality
- **Metadata extraction** - Read EXIF data and image properties

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Combining Tools

Tools work together seamlessly to accomplish complex tasks:

```typescript
// Multi-tool workflows
await agent.runTask(`
  1. Search for all API endpoints in the codebase
  2. Read the authentication middleware file
  3. Check if tests exist for each endpoint
  4. Create a security audit report
`);

// The agent automatically:
// 1. Uses grep_search to find API route definitions
// 2. Uses read_file to examine middleware implementation
// 3. Uses file_search to locate test files
// 4. Uses edit_file to create the audit report
```

### Error Handling

Built-in tools include robust error handling:

```typescript
// Tools gracefully handle various error conditions:
// - File not found errors
// - Permission denied issues
// - Invalid command syntax
// - Network connectivity problems
// - Disk space limitations
```

### Performance Considerations

**Efficient file reading:**
- Use line ranges instead of reading entire large files
- Specify precise sections when possible
- Let the agent choose appropriate ranges based on context

**Smart searching:**
- Use specific patterns to limit search scope
- Combine file_search with grep_search for efficient workflows
- Leverage glob patterns to focus on relevant files

**Terminal optimization:**
- Commands run in the project's working directory
- Environment variables are properly inherited
- Output is captured efficiently for analysis

## Tool Configuration

Built-in tools need to be explicitly registered based on your application's needs:

```typescript
// Create agent with empty McpServerManager
const agent = new ZypherAgent(modelProvider);

// Register only the built-in tools you need
agent.mcpServerManager.registerTool(ReadFileTool);
agent.mcpServerManager.registerTool(EditFileTool);

// Check registered tools
const allTools = agent.mcpServerManager.getAllTools();
console.log('Registered tools:', Array.from(allTools.keys()));
```

## Security Considerations

Built-in tools operate with appropriate security boundaries:

- **File system access** - Limited to the project workspace by default
- **Command execution** - Runs with the same permissions as the agent process
- **Path validation** - Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Safe operations** - Includes safeguards against destructive operations

## Best Practices

### File Operations
- **Use relative paths** - Keep file operations within the project scope
- **Read efficiently** - Use line ranges for large files
- **Validate before editing** - Let the agent examine files before making changes

### Terminal Commands
- **Check status** - Use commands like `git status` before making changes
- **Test safely** - Run tests in safe environments
- **Capture output** - Let the agent analyze command results

### Search Operations
- **Be specific** - Use precise patterns to reduce noise
- **Combine searches** - Use multiple search strategies for comprehensive results
- **Context matters** - Include surrounding lines when analyzing matches
